# Assignment 6 — Kubernetes Health Probes (Liveness)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this guided lab, you will add an HTTP liveness probe to NGINX, force repeated failures, observe container restarts, restore the healthy probe, and review safe tuning.

---

# Task 1 — Create the Baseline Deployment

## Goal

Deploy two NGINX Pods without probes (`00-nginx-deploy-baseline.yaml`).

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Baseline Deployment and two running Pods

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Add the Liveness Probe

## Goal

Add an HTTP liveness probe on `/` port 80 (`01-nginx-deploy-liveness.yaml`) and confirm the kubelet checks it every 10 seconds after the initial delay.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Pod description showing the liveness probe

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Trigger and Observe a Liveness Restart

## Goal

Change the liveness path to `/does-not-exist`, apply it, and watch `RESTARTS` increase over roughly 20 seconds.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Pod RESTARTS increment and the corresponding liveness failure events

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Restore and Stabilize the Probe

## Goal

Reapply the good liveness manifest and confirm restart counts stop increasing.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Stable Pod state after the fixed manifest is applied

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Review Tuning, Troubleshooting, and Cleanup

## Goal

Review recommended probe ranges and retain or delete the Deployment.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Final healthy state and any troubleshooting evidence used

Add your screenshot here.
