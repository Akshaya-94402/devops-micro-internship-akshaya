# Assignment 10 — Capstone: Deploy the Book Review App to Kubernetes

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this capstone assignment, you will deploy the Book Review App as a production-style three-tier application on Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE, Minikube, or k3s): a Next.js frontend behind Nginx exposed publicly, an internal Node.js/Express backend on port 3010, and a persistent or managed MySQL database — configured with ConfigMaps, Secrets, and validated end to end.

---

# Task 1 — Prepare the Kubernetes Cluster and Tooling

## Goal

Select a Kubernetes platform, confirm `kubectl` (and Helm, if used) can communicate with the cluster, and verify nodes are Ready.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Terminal showing the active Kubernetes context and Ready nodes

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 (if using Helm) — Terminal showing `helm version`

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Design the Three-Tier Kubernetes Architecture

## Goal

Create an architecture diagram showing the public entry point, frontend, internal backend, MySQL, ConfigMaps/Secrets, and the permitted traffic flow.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Completed Kubernetes architecture diagram

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Create ConfigMaps and Secrets

## Goal

Externalize non-sensitive configuration into ConfigMaps and sensitive values (database credentials, JWT secret) into Secrets, referenced from the Pod specs without committing plaintext values.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — ConfigMap manifest or `kubectl describe configmap` output showing non-sensitive configuration

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Secret object usage with sensitive values hidden or redacted

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Deploy and Configure the MySQL Data Tier

## Goal

Provide a persistent MySQL database (managed service or StatefulSet + PVC) reachable only by the backend, initialize the schema, and test connectivity.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Managed MySQL status or MySQL StatefulSet/PVC status

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Successful database connectivity or schema verification with credentials hidden

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Deploy the Backend Application Tier

## Goal

Run one or two Node.js/Express backend replicas on port 3010, expose them via ClusterIP (or internal LoadBalancer), and connect them to MySQL using ConfigMaps/Secrets.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Backend Deployment, Pods, and internal Service

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Backend logs showing successful startup and database connectivity

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 6 — Deploy the Frontend and Configure Nginx

## Goal

Run one or two Next.js frontend replicas behind Nginx on port 80, reverse-proxying to the backend's internal Service name.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — Frontend Deployment and Ready Pods

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Nginx reverse-proxy configuration showing the internal backend Service name

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 7 — Configure External and Internal Networking

## Goal

Expose only the frontend publicly (LoadBalancer or Ingress), restrict backend access to the frontend path (NetworkPolicy or platform equivalent), and confirm MySQL is not publicly reachable.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 12 — Frontend LoadBalancer or Ingress showing the public endpoint

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 13 — Internal backend Service and NetworkPolicy (or equivalent restriction)

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 8 — Validate the Application End to End

## Goal

Confirm the frontend loads publicly, a full user flow reaches the backend and MySQL, and collect operational evidence.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 14 — `kubectl get all` output

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 15 — Functional Book Review App in the browser with the public URL or IP visible

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 16 — Frontend Pod logs

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 17 — Backend Pod logs showing successful requests or database activity

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 18 (optional) — Kubernetes dashboard

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 9 — Implement Optional Production Enhancements

## Goal

Optionally package as a Helm chart, add HPA, add readiness/liveness probes, or configure TLS via cert-manager — without changing the core architecture.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 19 (optional) — Helm release, HPA, probes, or TLS evidence

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

Report the Kubernetes platform used, the public frontend URL/IP, a GitHub link to your manifests/Helm chart (if applicable), and the architecture diagram link. Summarize what worked, issues encountered and how they were resolved, and the tools/sources that helped the most.

Write your answer here.
