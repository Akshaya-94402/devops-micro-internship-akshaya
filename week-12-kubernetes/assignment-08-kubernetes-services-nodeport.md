# Assignment 8 — Kubernetes Services (NodePort)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this guided lab, you will expose NGINX on node port 30080, test it from outside and inside the cluster, break and fix the selector, and verify availability during Pod churn.

---

# Task 1 — Deploy the Probed NGINX Workload

## Goal

Create healthy, labeled NGINX Pods (readiness + liveness probes) for the NodePort Service.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Healthy NGINX Pods before Service creation

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Create the NodePort Service

## Goal

Create `nginx-svc-nodeport` (type `NodePort`, port 80, `nodePort: 30080`) and inspect the Service and endpoints.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Service output showing `80:30080` and populated endpoints

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Find a Node IP and Test Access

## Goal

Find a reachable node IP and test `<NODE_IP>:30080` externally (curl) and internally (from a `tester` Pod).

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Successful external or internal NodePort response

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Use the Environment-Specific Access Method

## Goal

Use the appropriate fallback for your cluster environment (`minikube service --url`, or port-forward for kind/Docker Desktop) to validate the Service.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Minikube helper URL or local validation result

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Break and Fix the Selector

## Goal

Change the selector to `app: does-not-match`, confirm endpoints empty and the request fails, then restore the good selector.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Empty then restored endpoint output

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 6 — Test Pod Churn and Clean Up

## Goal

Delete one backend Pod while calling the NodePort from another terminal, confirm the Service remains available, then optionally clean up.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Pod replacement while NodePort remains available

Add your screenshot here.
