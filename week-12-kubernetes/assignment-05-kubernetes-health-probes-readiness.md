# Assignment 5 — Kubernetes Health Probes (Readiness)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this guided lab, you will add an HTTP readiness probe to NGINX, intentionally break it, fix it, and prove that readiness gates Pod availability and safe rolling updates.

---

# Task 1 — Create the Baseline Deployment

## Goal

Deploy two NGINX Pods without probes (`00-nginx-deploy-baseline.yaml`) to establish the comparison state.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Baseline manifest and healthy two-Pod rollout output

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Add the Readiness Probe

## Goal

Add an HTTP readiness probe on `/` port 80 (`01-nginx-deploy-readiness.yaml`) and confirm Pods become Ready only after it succeeds.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Pod description showing the readiness probe and `Ready=True`

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Break and Fix Readiness

## Goal

Change the readiness path to `/does-not-exist`, observe `NotReady` and a stalled rollout, then restore the good manifest.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — `NotReady` conditions followed by a successful fixed rollout

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Prove Readiness-Gated Rolling Updates

## Goal

Perform a good image update to `nginx:1.21.2`, then attempt an update to `nginx:1.21.3` with a broken readiness patch, and confirm the rollout stalls before restoring the good spec.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Successful good rollout, stalled broken rollout, and successful recovery

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Review Tuning and Optional Cleanup

## Goal

Review probe timing/thresholds and retain or delete the Deployment.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Final healthy Pod state or optional cleanup output

Add your screenshot here.
