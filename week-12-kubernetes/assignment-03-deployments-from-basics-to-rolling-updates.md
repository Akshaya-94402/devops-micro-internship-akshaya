# Assignment 3 — Deployments: From Basics to Rolling Updates

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this guided lab, you will create an NGINX Deployment, add a zero-downtime RollingUpdate strategy, perform an image update, roll it back, and scale the workload.

---

# Task 1 — Set Up the Working Directory

## Goal

Create the `~/k8s-labs/deployments` working directory.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Terminal showing the `~/k8s-labs/deployments` working directory

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Create the Basic Deployment

## Goal

Create `nginx-deployment.yaml` with two replicas and image `nginx:1.21.1`, apply it, and verify the Deployment, ReplicaSet, and Pods.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Manifest plus `kubectl` output showing the Deployment, ReplicaSet, and two Pods

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Configure the RollingUpdate Strategy

## Goal

Add `strategy.rollingUpdate` with `maxSurge: 1` and `maxUnavailable: 0` to the Deployment and reapply it.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Deployment YAML showing the RollingUpdate strategy and successful apply output

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Perform and Roll Back an Image Update

## Goal

Update the image to `nginx:1.23.1` with `kubectl set image`, watch the rollout, then roll it back with `kubectl rollout undo` and check rollout history.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Rolling-update status, multiple ReplicaSets, and successful rollback/history output

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Scale the Deployment

## Goal

Scale to five replicas, verify, then scale back to two.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Terminal showing the scale-up and scale-down results

Add your screenshot here.
