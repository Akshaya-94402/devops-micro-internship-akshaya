# Assignment 4 — Docker Volumes

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will learn how Docker Volumes and Bind Mounts provide persistent storage for containers, deploying applications that retain logs and data even after containers are stopped or removed.

---

# Task 1 — Deploy a Standalone Application with Persistent Logs Using Bind Mounts

## Goal

Run an Nginx container (`myweb`) with a Bind Mount from `~/nginx-logs` to `/var/log/nginx`, verify the site loads, confirm logs are written, remove the container, and confirm the logs persist on the host.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `docker images`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `docker search nginx`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Successful `docker pull nginx` (if applicable)

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 4 — Creation of the `~/nginx-logs` directory

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Output of `docker run` with the Bind Mount

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 6 — Output of `docker ps` showing the running `myweb` container

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Browser displaying the Nginx Welcome Page

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Output of `ls ~/nginx-logs` showing `access.log` and `error.log`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Successful removal of the container

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Output of `ls ~/nginx-logs` confirming the log files remain after the container has been removed

# Task 2 — Deploy Two Containers with Persistent Data Using Docker Volumes

## Goal

Create a custom network `mynetwork` and a Docker volume `shared-data`, build and run a `backend` container that writes to the shared volume and a `frontend` container that reads from it, and confirm updates are reflected immediately.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Project folder structure

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `docker network create mynetwork`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `docker volume create shared-data`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 4 — Backend Dockerfile

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Successful backend image build

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 6 — Frontend Dockerfile

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Successful frontend image build

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Output of `docker ps` showing both containers

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Successful execution of `docker exec backend curl http://localhost/write`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Browser displaying "Hello from Backend!"

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Browser displaying "Test Data 1" after the first update
