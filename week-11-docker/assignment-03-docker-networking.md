# Assignment 3 — Docker Networking

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will explore Docker network types and deploy applications using different networking modes: the default bridge network, a custom bridge network for microservices, multiple networks for a multi-tier architecture, and host networking.

---

# Task 1 — Deploy a Standalone Application Using Docker Bridge Network

## Goal

List Docker networks, verify/pull the Nginx image, run an Nginx container (`myweb`) on the default bridge network with port 80 mapped, and verify it's reachable from a browser via the VM's public IP.

### Evidence

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `docker images`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `docker search nginx`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 4 — Successful `docker pull nginx` (if applicable)

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Output of `docker ps` showing the running `myweb` container

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 6 — Browser displaying the Nginx Welcome Page using the Public IP address

---

# Task 2 — Connect Multiple Containers Using a Custom Bridge Network

## Goal

Create a custom bridge network `mynetwork`, build and run a Node/Express `frontend` container and an Nginx `backend` container on it, and verify they can communicate by container name.

### Evidence

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `docker network ls`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Output of `docker network inspect mynetwork`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Successful `curl http://<Public-IP>` showing "Hello from Frontend"

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Successful `curl backend` output from the frontend container showing the Nginx Welcome Page

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Deploy a Multi-Tier Application Using Multiple Docker Networks

## Goal

Build a three-tier app (frontend, backend, MongoDB) across `backend-network` (backend ↔ database) and `frontend-network` (frontend ↔ backend), and verify data flows end to end.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Creation of `backend-network`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Creation of `frontend-network`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Project folder structure

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Browser showing the frontend application

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Successful `curl api` from the frontend container

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 13 — MongoDB connection using `mongosh`

---

#### Screenshot 15 — Successful retrieval of the inserted document

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Deploy an Application Using Docker Host Network Mode

## Goal

Deploy an Nginx container (`fastapp`) using Host Network Mode and verify it's reachable without explicit port mapping, then confirm the `NetworkMode` and clean up.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `docker run --network host`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `docker ps` showing the running `fastapp` container

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Browser or terminal displaying the Nginx Welcome Page

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 4 — Output of `docker inspect fastapp | grep "NetworkMode"`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Successful cleanup showing `docker stop fastapp` and `docker rm fastapp`

Add your screenshot here.

---

# LinkedIn Post (Optional)

## Goal

Create a LinkedIn post covering the assignment objective, networking modes explored, key learning outcomes, and a short reflection on Docker networking concepts.
