# Assignment 2 — Multi-Stage Docker Build for a React Application

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build both a single-stage and an optimized multi-stage Docker image for a React application, compare the resulting image sizes, and deploy the optimized version using a production-ready Nginx runtime container.

---

# Task 1 — Prepare the Project

## Goal

Clone `https://github.com/pravinmishraaws/my-react-app.git` and create a `.dockerignore` excluding `node_modules`, `build`, and `.env`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Contents of the `.dockerignore` file

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Create a Single-Stage Docker Image

## Goal

Create `Dockerfile.single`, build `react-single`, and run it on port 3000.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Contents of `Dockerfile.single`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Browser displaying the application running from the single-stage container

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Create a Multi-Stage Docker Build

## Goal

Create a multi-stage Dockerfile with separate build and Nginx runtime stages, build `react-multistage`, and run it on port 80.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Contents of the multi-stage Dockerfile

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Browser displaying the application running from the multi-stage container

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Compare Docker Image Sizes

## Goal

Compare the single-stage and multi-stage image sizes and calculate the percentage reduction.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Docker image list showing both image sizes

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Analyze the Optimization Results

## Goal

Write a 5–8 line analysis covering the percentage reduction, security benefits, reduced attack surface, faster distribution, and one build-caching optimization used.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Analysis included in your submission document

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

Write your analysis here.

Write your answer here.

---

# Task 6 — Explore Additional Production Optimizations (Optional)

## Goal

Optionally configure an Nginx health check, cache headers, parameterized ports via environment variables, or a lighter runtime image, and compare results.

> Screenshot optional.

---

# LinkedIn Post (Optional)

## Goal

Create a LinkedIn post describing what you built, what a multi-stage Docker build is, the image size reduction achieved, and key learnings.

## Evidence

#### LinkedIn Post URL

Paste your LinkedIn post URL here:
