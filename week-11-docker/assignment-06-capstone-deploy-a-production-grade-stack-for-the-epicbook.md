# Assignment 6 — Capstone: Deploy a Production-Grade Stack for The EpicBook

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this capstone assignment, you will take the EpicBook application from source code to a fully hardened, production-ready Docker Compose deployment on a cloud VM: multi-stage Dockerfiles, network isolation, healthchecks, persistent volumes with a backup plan, structured logging, a secure reverse proxy, and an operations runbook — with an optional CI/CD pipeline.

---

# Task 0 — App Discovery & Architecture

## Goal

Explore the `theepicbook` repository, identify its components (UI, API, DB, workers), document required environment variables/ports/persistence paths, and draw a component architecture diagram.

### Evidence

#### Deliverable — `docs/01-architecture-diagram.png`

Add your diagram or link here.

---

#### Deliverable — `docs/02-env-and-ports.md`

Add your content or link here.

---

# Task 1 — Multi-Stage Dockerfiles

## Goal

Create minimal multi-stage Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend services, with `.dockerignore` files to keep the build context lightweight.

### Evidence

#### Deliverable — `frontend/Dockerfile`, `backend/Dockerfile`, and `.dockerignore` files, with a note on layer optimizations and security benefits

Add your content or link here.

---

# Task 2 — Compose Stack & Networks

## Goal

Author `docker-compose.yml` defining the reverse-proxy, frontend, backend, and database services, isolated front-tier/back-tier networks, and named volumes.

### Evidence

#### Deliverable — `docker-compose.yml`

Add your content or link here.

---

# Task 3 — Healthchecks & Startup Order

## Goal

Add a database healthcheck, a `/health` endpoint check on the backend, and `depends_on` conditions checking `service_healthy`.

### Evidence

#### Deliverable — `docs/03-healthchecks-and-depends-on.md`

Add your content or link here.

---

# Task 4 — Reverse Proxy & CORS Config

## Goal

Configure Nginx or Traefik to route `/api` to the backend and `/` to the frontend, with an appropriate CORS allowlist on the backend.

### Evidence

#### Deliverable — `docs/04-proxy-routing-and-cors.md`

Add your content or link here.

---

# Task 5 — Persistence & Backups

## Goal

Mount the database data directory to a named volume, document a snapshot/backup plan, and run a live snapshot restore drill.

### Evidence

#### Deliverable — `docs/05-persistence-and-backup.md`

Add your content or link here.

---

#### Screenshot — System state before and after a manual snapshot restore cycle

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 6 — Logging & Observability

## Goal

Bind-mount the reverse proxy log directory to the host, redirect application logs to stdout or named volumes, and enable structured JSON logging where supported.

### Evidence

#### Deliverable — `docs/06-logging-layout.md`

Add your content or link here.

---

#### Screenshot — Live running JSON container log entries

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 7 — Cloud Deployment (AWS or Azure)

## Goal

Provision a VM per the security requirements (SSH restricted to your IP; HTTP/HTTPS open), install Docker, and bring the full stack up with a working public URL.

### Evidence

#### Deliverable — `docs/07-cloud-deployment-notes.md` (ports, firewall rules, deployment link)

Add your content or link here.

---

#### Screenshot — Browser showing successful web UI retrieval via the cloud public IP

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot — Active page interaction confirming backend API data fetches succeed

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 8 — CI/CD Pipeline (Optional)

## Goal

Build a pipeline (Azure Pipelines or GitHub Actions) that builds and tags multi-stage images and automates deployment via SSH restart steps.

### Evidence

#### Deliverable — `docs/08-ci-cd-pipeline.md`

Add your content or link here.

---

#### Screenshot (optional) — Completed automated pipeline run

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 9 — Reliability Tests & Ops Runbook

## Goal

Inject faults (drop backend/database dependencies) and evaluate frontend error handling, then write an operations runbook covering startup, shutdown, secret rotation, and disaster recovery.

### Evidence

#### Deliverable — `docs/09-runbook.md`

Add your content or link here.

---

#### Deliverable — `docs/10-reliability-tests.md`

Add your content or link here.

---

# LinkedIn Post (Required)

## Goal

Publish a 6–10 line LinkedIn post covering the architectural decision that most improved reliability, the biggest image size reduction achieved (with numbers), and your key production-hardening takeaways.

## Evidence

#### LinkedIn Post URL

Paste your LinkedIn post URL here:

`Add your URL here`

---

#### Screenshot — Published LinkedIn post showing the text body and a deployment verification image

Add your screenshot here.
